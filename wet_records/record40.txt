“Roger and I wanted to thank you for making our wedding reception a dream come true…”
“We and our guests had such an amazing time. It was a lovely night, with glamorous décor and incredible food. We couldn’t have asked for better service and attention than what all of you and your staff provided. It was a night we will never forget!”
– Leesa & Roger F.
“Thank you for all of your help in my wedding luncheon.”
“You have been fabulous! You’ve been attentive, efficient and so pleasant to work with. While I know my event was very small and intimate, I’d trust you with a thousand! I knew from our first phone conversation that you were on the ball, and I am blessed to have my special day luncheon at your facility. Thanks for everything!”
– Jennifer Y.
“It was a pleasure working with you during our wedding process!”
“We heard nothing but overwhelmingly positive comments and compliments about the entire night (food, cake, venue, bar and the list goes on.) What a magical night it was for us and everyone included! We loved every minute of it!”
– Brian and Lisa S.
“Thank you so much for making our meeting such a success.”
“I have had positive remarks, one of which was ‘It was perfect!’ I appreciate your flexibility and advice as we planned the event!”
– Georgia W. – North Highland
“Atlanta Sports Council...luncheon a huge success.”
“On behalf of the Atlanta Sports Council, I wanted to thank you for everything you did to make our basketball luncheon a huge success. As I mentioned before, we’ve received fantastic feedback on the event, the food and service were excellent. Please don’t hesitate to call if I can ever help you out here at the ASC.”
– Ken C. – Atlanta Sports Council
“There have been 'rave reviews'...”
“We want to thank the 103 West Staff for the wonderful party you helped provide for us last weekend. There have been 'rave reviews' and from a very discriminating Atlanta Group.
From the valet parking to the service, food, drinks, ambience and attitude, everything went better than we had expected. We also appreciate the very professional manner in which you handled our needs. The piano player that was recommended did a fine job and gave the evening the touch we wanted it to have. Please be assured that when the next occasion presents itself we will again come to 103 West. In the meantime, we will highly recommend it and you when we have the opportunity.”
– Leon and Barbara A.
“Everything went really, really well!”
“The best comment that I received was from our Regional Managing Partner (he is the highest ranking in our region). He said the food was the best we have ever had at any of our events. Thanks again for all of your help. The team was great to work with over there!”
– Heather R. - BDO
“All in all, another memorable event that we have received many compliments for!”
“As you know this was our third event at 103 West in the last month and just like the other two was incredible. Thank you for working with us to accommodate the ongoing changes with party size. In the end, the larger side of the ballroom was an excellent choice and gave us a lot more room to socialize and interact with our guests. Again, the food and wine we selected for our custom menu was absolutely delicious from appetizers to the memorable Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert. Our compliments again to the chef and kitchen staff. The on-site manager, the entire wait-staff, and valets were courteous and professional and catered to our needs. Courses were served timely and piping hot. All in all, another memorable event that we have received many compliments for! We look forward to working with you again on future dinner events.”
– Bob J. – Balfour Beatty Construction
