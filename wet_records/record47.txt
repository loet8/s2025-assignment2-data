Paolo Verzone -- A Manifesto of Disorder
My quest for imperfection
All my work as a photographer is a chess game with imperfection, but it’s a rigged game, one where I always try to lose the chess match instead of trying to win, by letting imperfection get in my pictures.
I’ve always been afraid of the idea of a perfect picture. In itself perfection is something so close to death and so far from life that I always try to stay far away from it. This book is an ode to imperfection and all the pleasures that it can provide.
Paolo Verzone is a photographer with Agence VU. Follow him on Instagram @paoloverzone, and see more of his work here.
